-- 1. Identify bestsellers and their delivery metrics
WITH bestsellers AS (
    SELECT 
        product_name,
        COUNT(orderid) as total_orders,
        SUM(product_price) as total_revenue,

    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY total_revenue DESC) as revenue_rank
FROM bestsellers
WHERE total_orders >= 100  -- Additional filter for significant products
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC

-- 2. Daily delivery performance for top products
WITH top_products AS (

-- 3. Delivery performance by carrier for bestsellers

-- 4. Weekly trend analysis for delivery issues
SELECT

-- 5. Additional analysis: Price range impact on delivery
WITH price_ranges AS (

        CASE 
            WHEN product_price < 100 THEN 'Low (<100)'
