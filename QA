Most AI chat applications like ChatGPT typically use HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE) rather than WebSocket. Here's why:

ChatGPT Approach:


Uses HTTP with SSE (Server-Sent Events)
No WebSocket connection
Client sends HTTP POST request
Server keeps connection open and streams responses
Each token is sent as it's generated

Why SSE over WebSocket:


Simpler to implement
Better support for HTTP features (caching, headers, etc.)
Works better with existing infrastructure
Less overhead for this use case
No need for bidirectional communication


When WebSocket IS Used:


Real-time collaborative features (like Google Docs)
Multi-user chat rooms
Live coding environments
Gaming applications
When you need true bidirectional communication

The key difference is that AI chat applications usually don't need constant bidirectional communication - they just need to stream the response back to the user, which SSE handles perfectly well.
